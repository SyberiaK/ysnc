**"You Shall Not Climb!" (YSNC)** is a Fabric server-side mod that takes away an ability to climb ladders from mobs that are not supposed to have it.

[MC-148545 **"Mobs can climb ladders"**](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-148545) was labeled by Mojang as **"Works As Intended"**.

Obviously, this doesn't make any sense since most of the mobs don't use ladders deliberately.

It feels more like a side effect that is actually easy to fix, which is what this mod does.
